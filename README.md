# OpusRace
My A Level Computer Science coding project. Fork the project and un-comment the lines which will drop the ghosts and results .db files, re-comment the lines and run to see personal ghosts and results recorded. Times will be recorded regardless of race mode (time trial or create ghost), but ghosts will only be recorded on create ghost races.

## General controls
 - Press `t` while on a track to switch tracks. 
 - Press `r` to restart on the current track. 
 - Press `Esc` to go back. 
 - Select elements with `LMB`.

## Tracks
There are 5 tracks in total. The leaderboard will show times for the currently selected track.

## Cars
Go to the cars menu to select between 5 different car skins, there is no difference in performance or hitboxes.

## Optimization
At the moment it runs slower than intended on most computers. It seems to run faster up until a certain point based on computer hardware. It generally runs slowest on MacOS, slightly faster on Windows and almost at intended speed on Linux.

## Incomplete features
 - Ghosts shown should be the fasest ghosts recorded, at the moment it is the first ghosts recorded.
 - More cars (art for these were already completed).

## Bugs
 - The slowest time sometimes appears at the top of the leaderboard, however, the splits are still correct for the fastest time.
 
## Improvements
 - Improve performance.
 - Put picture/database files into a separate folders.
 - Split main file into multiple files and refactor entire codebase.
 - Add AI to learn the best racing lines.
 - Add a mode to compare human runs to AI ones, to see where the human player can improve.
 - Add more tracks.
